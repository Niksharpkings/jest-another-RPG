# Jest Another RPG
UCLA Extension Full-Stack Development web, Bootcamp Project #10

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and JavaScript. For this Challenge assignment, I'll create a generator that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I'll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes them.In order to succeed in this Challenge, 
I'll apply the following skills: 
1) Build an entire application using object-oriented programming (OOP), separating data and functionality into different constructor functions. 
2) Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes. 
3) Verify that your code works as intended through automated tests using the Jest framework.
4) Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line. 

Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line. My game will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and I'll also implement basic code tests using the Jest framework. 

By completing this module I'll learn how to:
1) Integrate constructor functions into your applications, adding structure to your code and reducing the amount of code you have to write.
2) Build entire applications using OOP, separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions that can be composed together. 
3) Verify that your code works as intended by using automated tests. 
4) Build applications using test-driven development, writing tests before implementing functionality. 
5) Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance. 
6) Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm. | in this module, I'll create a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion.

**DEMO MOCK-UP Not Real/Fake Story (part of the assignment)**
My progress is so impressive that it has garnered the attention of a recruiter named Val. Val works at Silica Enterprises and is recruiting developers for various game studios. This is excitingâ€”congratulations! Part of the application process is a take-home assignment that will test you on two things: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm in which code is organized around objects instead of functions. This approach has the added advantage of helping us follow DRY practices.Test-driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing tests before writing code. 

Here's a snapshot of the TDD process: 
1) Write a failing test before writing any code. 
2) Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass. 
Refactor the code. 

Using TDD helps us write code that's maintainable and follows best practices. It also gives us a little peace of mind as developers, knowing that the parts of our code that have tests are less likely to break unexpectedly. If our code does break at some point, it will be much easier to identify how to debug it because the failing tests will let us know exactly what went wrong.

Val has given me Val has given you the following assignment: create a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which a user battles against a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by a potion. The solution must meet the following four criteria: 
1) Create an RPG and organize the code by player objects, enemy objects, and potion objects. 
2) The three main objects should have tests written for them. 
3) A fourth Game object encompasses all of the game logic. 
4) The game can be played in the command line based on user input.

All of this will make a lot more sense when you see it in action, so let me get it started!
